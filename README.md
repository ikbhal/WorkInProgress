you write down what you feel
but this it will sync to cloud
you can share you rough code, make it public if you want
you can search in other places too 
if you have client installed
even you can write small 15 minutes, task
complete, it will trigger time

how many succeded
if you reached some milestone
you can share it online with facebook, twitter, all it once
its you can write some text to go to multiple places destination
